# 🖼️ Image Voter

A simple browser-based image voting game.

Users can upload new contestants (images), click on them to increase their score, and remove contestants they no longer want. Below the image list, the app dynamically shows who is currently leading the competition.

## 🎯 Features

- Upload an image and add it to the competition  
- Click on an image to increase its score  
- Remove any image with a single click  
- Automatically update and display the current leader

## 🚀 Goals

This project is built to learn:

- DOM manipulation  
- Event handling  
- Dynamic element creation  
- Working with FileReader API  
- Basic game logic (score tracking and winner calculation)

## 🛠️ Planned Steps (Work in Progress)

1. Handle form submission and image upload  
2. Create a visual block for each contestant (image, score, remove button)  
3. Append new contestants to the page  
4. Add event listeners for score increase and image removal  
5. Track and display the current leader based on the highest score  
6. Recalculate the leader whenever the score changes or a contestant is removed

## 📝 Credits

The initial HTML and CSS structure used in this project was provided as part of the [JavaScript Academy course by Skillmea](https://skillmea.cz/academy/javascript), and is available in the `starter-template` folder.

All JavaScript code was written by me from scratch as part of my learning process and task development.
